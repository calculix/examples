#Purpose:
#Segment of a turbo-charger turbine rotor with 12 blades
#under cenrtifugal, thermal and pressure load.

#Do the following:

goto ../therm and run the example to generate the temperature field
goto ../map and run the example to map the pressure and temperature
        to the mesh specified in mesh.fbl

cgx -b send.fbl
ccx latim
cgx latim.frd latim.inp

#In cgx type:

copy all b2 rot x 30

#REMARK:
#you may change the element type in mesh.fbl:
#from he20r to he8 ( or te4 or te10, but requires netgen installed) 

#The file mesh.fbl is also used in ../map and ../therm
